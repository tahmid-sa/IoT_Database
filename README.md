Introduction

The development of wireless sensor nodes specific for environmental monitoring using the Long-Range
Wireless Access Network (LoRaWAN) has become a focus in the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. Environmental 
monitoring requires various climatic and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, water level and
soil moisture. Throughout this project, the utilization of two specific sensors, the eTape water level sensor and the 
SHT31 temperature and humidity sensor, has provided the measurement of these environmental parameters needed
for monitoring using LoRaWAN. These two sensors were used in this project with a Dragino supplied LoRaWAN 
sensor node, the LSN50 and a supplied gateway. After necessary connection and programming between these 
sensors, the sensor node and gateway, monitoring could reflect the desired environmental parameters.

Purpose of the system

The overall monitoring system consists of two separate monitoring subsystems. Firstly, the eTape sensor 
and the LSN50 will be connected to a gateway to deliver water level data to The Things Network (TTN). This data 
will then be visualized using Cayenne My Devices, such that various water levels and LSN50 battery values are 
measured in different nodes with respect to time. Secondly, the SHT31 sensor will also be connected to the LSN50 
and a gateway to deliver temperature and humidity data of different nodes. This data will also be visualized with 
respect to time.
